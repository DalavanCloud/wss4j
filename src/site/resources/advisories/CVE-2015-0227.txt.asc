CVE-2015-0227: Apache WSS4J doesn't correctly enforce the requireSignedEncryptedDataElements property

Severity: Major

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache WSS4J prior to 1.6.17 and
2.0.2.

Description:

Apache WSS4J has a "requireSignedEncryptedDataElements" boolean configuration
property, which if set enforces that EncryptedData elements are in a signed
subtree of the document. The default value of this property is "false". 
However, it is possible to circumvent this setting by various types of
wrapping attacks.

This has been fixed in revision:

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1619359

Migration:

WSS4J 1.6.x users should upgrade to 1.6.17 or later as soon as possible.
WSS4J 2.0.x users should upgrade to 2.0.2 or later as soon as possible.
